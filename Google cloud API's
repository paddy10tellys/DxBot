 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs that provide access to pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call:
 Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API and Cloud Video API.
 Using these APIs, you can focus on adding new features to your app rather than building and training your own custom models.
 In this session we'll share an overview of each API and dive into code with some live demos.
